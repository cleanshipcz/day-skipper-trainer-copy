# docx-export

Convert a .docx document to Markdown with extracted images using the bundled converter script. Use whenever a Word document needs a Markdown export or an existing export needs regenerating after the docx changed.

# DOCX → Markdown export

This skill ships its own converter — do not use pandoc, markitdown, or write a new script.

## How to run

The converter is bundled with this skill at [scripts/docx_to_markdown.py](scripts/docx_to_markdown.py) (path relative to this skill's directory).

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/docx_to_markdown.py "<path/to/Document Name>.docx"
```

- Output lands next to the source docx, with spaces in the name replaced by underscores: `Document_Name.md` plus a `Document_Name_images/` folder.
- Requires `python-docx` (`pip install python-docx`).
- `--image-format none` produces a text-only export without the images folder.
- An explicit output path can be passed as a second argument, but the default (next to the docx) is the convention.

## Regenerating an existing export

Delete the old images folder first, otherwise stale numbered images survive:

```bash
rm -rf "<dir>/Document_Name_images" && python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/docx_to_markdown.py "<dir>/<Document Name>.docx"
```

## Intentional behaviors — do not "fix" these

- Tracked-change deletions (`w:del`) are excluded from the output; insertions (`w:ins`) are included. The export shows the accepted-changes view, so the image count can be lower than the media count inside the docx zip.
- Header/footer images (logos, watermarks) are not extracted.
- Heading levels mirror the docx styles exactly — a flat hierarchy in the output means the source uses Heading 1 everywhere.
- Tables containing images or nested tables render as labeled sections instead of pipe tables; that is deliberate, for readability.
- OMML equations become best-effort LaTeX (`$...$` / `$$...$$`), hyperlinks become `[text](url)`, checkbox content controls keep their ☒/☐ state.

## After converting

Leave the generated files uncommitted — the user always commits themselves, never do it for them.
